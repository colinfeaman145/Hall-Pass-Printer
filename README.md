# Hall-Pass-Printer

A capstone project from my senior year. 
This was a part of the requirements to graduate high school with an associates degree. 

The code is a one page interface intended to be open on laptops in classrooms for students to use.
The interface consists of a few easy fields for a student to populate. 
Then a repurposed reciept printer would print a hall pass with the required information 
for a student to traverse the halls with. 

The project also intended to alleviate the teacher from excusing students from the classroom.
The website would record passes printed and duration gone for teachers to review
and act with at a later point. It can also be used as an attendance monitor during emergency
situations.

Note: This is me and my teams first exposure to Html and Css so the code is very bad
